----Exavier's Units

Description['eal0301'] = "Hidden from prying eyes a small faction of the Aeon have developed a minature personal teleporter capable of being mounted on a standerd combat bot. While weaker than the average unit of this size the ability to move about the abttlefield quickly has made this a harassment unit of choice."
Description['eeb0402'] = "With recent improvments on matter compression and containment it is now possible to harness the energies of the stars themselves. When powered up this facility creates and maintains a minature sun which can then be harvested for energy and mass resorces. However the facility is still a prototype and may not react well to incomming fire."
Description['eel0401'] = "Developed by a hidden branch within the UEF the Disruptor uses an array of modulated frequency crystals to create a rift of disruptive waves. Unfortunatly this wave is not as focused as normal energy weapon which allows smaller units to not be as affected by it. For mobility reasons this unit has been designed to float on the surface of the water."
Description['ees0301'] = "Deciding it was time to create a new submarine to escort the Atlantis carriers the UEF iniciated the Seawolf project. This submarine combines aspects of the believed lost Deepwatch submarine missile barrage system with deployable anti-air SAMs and a deck gun designed to punch through naval armor. It has also been outfitted with a surface launched Tactical Nuclear Missile system and a nice surprise for any hovercraft that happen to enter the area."
Description['ees0302'] = "With the increasing use of heavy torpedo bombers and tactical weapons it was decided that an escort fricate would extend the life of the fleet. Primary systems include a Hyper Velocity Missile launcher and a pair of combination TMD/Flak AA cannons. For offensive systems it is configured with four banks of short ranged guided cruise missiles backed up by a torpedo defense system that provides 360 degree coverage."
Description['ers0302'] = "Aries Attack Frigate"
Description['eas0302'] = "Messiah Escort Frigate"
